> "The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new." - Dan Millman

As we step into 2026, I'm filled with excitement and gratitude for the journey that brought us here. 2025 was a year of transformation, challenges, and profound realizations. Let me share some reflections and my vision for this new year.

## 💪 Health

### The Wake-Up Call

2025 brought some sobering news that changed my perspective on everything. I was diagnosed with:

- **Stage 2 Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**: A clear signal that I needed to make significant lifestyle changes
- **Dyslipidemia**: Complex cholesterol and triglyceride issues revealed through my November 2025 blood tests
- **Obesity**: At my initial weigh-in of 140.4 kg, my BMI was 35.8, which falls into the Obese category

These diagnoses were a wake-up call—a reminder that our health isn't something to take for granted. It's not just about me; it's about being there for my family, for the long haul. No career achievement or material success means anything if we don't have our health.

### My Health Commitment

My health is my foundation. Without it, nothing else matters. I'm committed to:
- Following medical guidance and treatment plans diligently
- Making sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management)
- Practicing **intermittent fasting** to support metabolic health
- **Watching calories** and maintaining mindful eating habits
- Engaging in **weekly HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) exercises** to improve cardiovascular fitness
- Regular monitoring and check-ups
- Being accountable to myself and my loved ones

## 🫶 Family

### Making Memories

Family isn't just important—it's everything. In 2026, I'm dedicating more quality time, presence, and energy to the people who matter most. Building memories, strengthening bonds, and being truly present for life's moments—big and small.

### Goodbye Kuga, Hello Jetour

Sometimes life throws you curveballs, and you just have to adapt. Our trusty Ford Kuga, after serving us well for 210,000 kilometers, decided it was time for retirement when the engine gave out. While it was bittersweet to say goodbye to a vehicle that had been part of so many family memories, it opened the door to something new.

We're excited about getting a **Jetour T2 Odyssey in Black**—a fresh start on four wheels, ready for new adventures and countless kilometers of family memories ahead!

## 💰 Wealth

### Growing Family Wealth

Financial security provides peace of mind and opportunities for the future. I'm committed to:
- Making informed financial decisions
- Building sustainable income streams
- Creating a legacy for my family
- Balancing present enjoyment with future planning

### 19 Years at Derivco: Building the Future Together

As I step into 2026, I'm also approaching another incredible milestone: **19 years with [Derivco](https://derivco.com)**, a global leader in the online gaming industry. It's been a journey of continuous growth, innovation, and transformation—especially over the past 18 months.

2025 brought significant organizational changes that reshaped how we work and the challenges we face. While change is never easy, it has been a powerful catalyst for growth, innovation, and resilience. The lessons learned from navigating these transitions have made us stronger, both as individuals and as a team.

#### Working Smarter with AI 🤖

One of the most exciting aspects of this transformation has been embracing cutting-edge technologies, particularly **AI**. At Derivco, we're not just observing the AI revolution—we're actively leveraging it to work smarter, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on what truly matters: innovation, creativity, and delivering exceptional value.

AI has become an integral part of my daily workflow—from coding assistance to problem-solving, architecture decisions to optimization strategies. However, this powerful tool has also highlighted one of the most critical challenges we face: **balancing speed and quality**. AI enables us to move faster than ever before, but speed without quality is just recklessness. Finding that sweet spot—where we leverage AI's capabilities while maintaining the craftsmanship and attention to detail that truly matters—remains an ongoing challenge. It's a balance I'm committed to mastering in 2026.

#### Resilience Through Change 💪

The organizational changes of 2025 taught me valuable lessons about resilience and adaptation. Saying goodbye to talented colleagues and friends was difficult, but it also reinforced the importance of supporting one another, staying positive, and focusing on building something even better. For those of us who remain, we have a unique opportunity to help shape Derivco's future—bringing our best ideas, dedication, and passion to create something extraordinary.

#### Looking Forward to Year 19 🚀

As I approach my 19th year at Derivco, I'm more excited than ever about what lies ahead. The challenges are bigger, the technology is advancing faster, and the opportunities to make a meaningful impact are greater than ever. I'm grateful for the incredible people I work with, whose creativity and determination continue to inspire me every day.

Here's to another year of growth, innovation, and pushing boundaries together!

## 🌟 Looking Forward

2026 represents a turning point—a year where I'm choosing to prioritize what truly matters. The lessons from 2025, both the challenges and the triumphs, have shaped a clearer vision for the road ahead.

Here's to a year of balance, growth, intentional living, and meaningful progress. Here's to health, family, and building a future we can all be proud of.

**Happy New Year! Let's make 2026 extraordinary! 🎊**
