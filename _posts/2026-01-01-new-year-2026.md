> "The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new." - Dan Millman

As we step into 2026, I'm filled with excitement and gratitude for the journey that brought us here. 2025 was a year of transformation, challenges, and profound realizations. Let me share some reflections and my vision for this new year.

## 🤖 The AI Revolution in Our Daily Work

2025 truly cemented AI as an indispensable part of how we work. It's no longer a novelty or a future concept—it's here, it's now, and it's changing everything. I find myself using AI daily, from coding assistance to problem-solving, content creation to decision support.

However, this powerful tool has also highlighted one of the most critical challenges we face: **balancing speed and quality**. AI enables us to move faster than ever before, but speed without quality is just recklessness. Finding that sweet spot—where we leverage AI's capabilities while maintaining the craftsmanship and attention to detail that truly matters—remains an ongoing challenge. It's a balance I'm committed to mastering in 2026.

## 🚗 Life's Unexpected Turns: Goodbye Kuga, Hello Jetour

Sometimes life throws you curveballs, and you just have to adapt. Our trusty Ford Kuga, after serving us well for 210,000 kilometers, decided it was time for retirement when the engine gave out. While it was bittersweet to say goodbye to a vehicle that had been part of so many family memories, it opened the door to something new.

We're excited about getting a **Jetour T2 Odyssey in Black**—a fresh start on four wheels, ready for new adventures and countless kilometers of family memories ahead!

## ❤️‍🩹 A Wake-Up Call: Prioritizing Health

2025 brought some sobering news that changed my perspective on everything. I was diagnosed with:

- **Stage 2 Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**: A clear signal that I needed to make significant lifestyle changes
- **Dyslipidemia**: Complex cholesterol and triglyceride issues revealed through my November 2025 blood tests
- **Obesity**: At my initial weigh-in of 140.4 kg, my BMI was 35.8, which falls into the Obese category

These diagnoses were a wake-up call—a reminder that our health isn't something to take for granted. It's not just about me; it's about being there for my family, for the long haul. No career achievement or material success means anything if we don't have our health.

## 🎯 My 2026 Resolutions: A Renewed Focus

This year, my resolutions are clear, purposeful, and deeply personal:

### 1. 💪🏻 Health First, Always

My health is my foundation. Without it, nothing else matters. I'm committed to:
- Following medical guidance and treatment plans diligently
- Making sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management)
- Practicing **intermittent fasting** to support metabolic health
- **Watching calories** and maintaining mindful eating habits
- Engaging in **weekly HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) exercises** to improve cardiovascular fitness
- Regular monitoring and check-ups
- Being accountable to myself and my loved ones

### 2. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family at the Center

Family isn't just important—it's everything. In 2026, I'm dedicating more quality time, presence, and energy to the people who matter most. Building memories, strengthening bonds, and being truly present for life's moments—big and small.

### 3. 💰 Growing Family Wealth

Financial security provides peace of mind and opportunities for the future. I'm committed to:
- Making informed financial decisions
- Building sustainable income streams
- Creating a legacy for my family
- Balancing present enjoyment with future planning

## 🌟 Looking Forward

2026 represents a turning point—a year where I'm choosing to prioritize what truly matters. The lessons from 2025, both the challenges and the triumphs, have shaped a clearer vision for the road ahead.

Here's to a year of balance, growth, intentional living, and meaningful progress. Here's to health, family, and building a future we can all be proud of.

**Happy New Year! Let's make 2026 extraordinary! 🎊**
