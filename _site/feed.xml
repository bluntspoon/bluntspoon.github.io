  <p>“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.” - Dan Millman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we step into 2026, I’m filled with excitement and gratitude for the journey that brought us here. 2025 was a year of transformation, challenges, and profound realizations. Let me share some reflections and my vision for this new year.</p>

<h2 id="-health">💪 Health</h2>

<h3 id="the-wake-up-call">The Wake-Up Call</h3>

<p>2025 brought some sobering news that changed my perspective on everything. I was diagnosed with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stage 2 Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</strong>: A clear signal that I needed to make significant lifestyle changes</li>
  <li><strong>Dyslipidemia</strong>: Complex cholesterol and triglyceride issues revealed through my November 2025 blood tests</li>
  <li><strong>Obesity</strong>: At my initial weigh-in of 140.4 kg, my BMI was 35.8, which falls into the Obese category</li>
</ul>

<p>These diagnoses were a wake-up call—a reminder that our health isn’t something to take for granted. It’s not just about me; it’s about being there for my family, for the long haul. No career achievement or material success means anything if we don’t have our health.</p>

<h3 id="my-health-commitment">My Health Commitment</h3>

<p>My health is my foundation. Without it, nothing else matters. I’m committed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Following medical guidance and treatment plans diligently</li>
  <li>Making sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress management)</li>
  <li>Practicing <strong>intermittent fasting</strong> to support metabolic health</li>
  <li><strong>Watching calories</strong> and maintaining mindful eating habits</li>
  <li>Engaging in <strong>weekly HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) exercises</strong> to improve cardiovascular fitness</li>
  <li>Regular monitoring and check-ups</li>
  <li>Being accountable to myself and my loved ones</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-family">🫶 Family</h2>

<h3 id="making-memories">Making Memories</h3>

<p>Family isn’t just important—it’s everything. In 2026, I’m dedicating more quality time, presence, and energy to the people who matter most. Building memories, strengthening bonds, and being truly present—that’s what this year is about.</p>

<p>I’m excited about our plans to <strong>travel together and explore new places</strong> as a family. Whether it’s discovering new destinations, revisiting favorite spots, or simply taking weekend getaways, these adventures will be the foundation of lasting memories. Travel isn’t just about the places we go—it’s about the experiences we share, the laughter along the way, and the stories we’ll tell for years to come.</p>

<p>Beyond travel, I’m committed to creating <strong>special moments in our everyday lives</strong>—family dinners without distractions, game nights, outdoor activities, and simply being present for the big and small moments alike. Quality time isn’t measured in grand gestures but in consistent, intentional presence.</p>

<h3 id="goodbye-kuga-hello-jetour">Goodbye Kuga, Hello Jetour</h3>

<p>Sometimes life throws you curveballs, and you just have to adapt. Our trusty Ford Kuga, after serving us well for 210,000 kilometers, decided it was time for retirement when the engine gave out. While it was bittersweet to say goodbye to a vehicle that had been part of so many family memories, it opened the door to something new.</p>

<p>We’re excited about getting a <strong>Jetour T2 Odyssey in Black</strong>—a fresh start on four wheels, ready for new adventures and countless kilometers of family memories ahead!</p>

<h2 id="-wealth">💰 Wealth</h2>

<h3 id="growing-family-wealth">Growing Family Wealth</h3>

<p>Financial security provides peace of mind and opportunities for the future. I’m committed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making informed financial decisions</li>
  <li>Building sustainable income streams</li>
  <li>Creating a legacy for my family</li>
  <li>Balancing present enjoyment with future planning</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="19-years-at-derivco-building-the-future-together">19 Years at Derivco: Building the Future Together</h3>

<p>As I step into 2026, I’m also approaching another incredible milestone: <strong>19 years with <a href="https://derivco.com">Derivco</a></strong>, a global leader in the online gaming industry. It’s been a journey of continuous growth, innovation, and transformation—especially over the past 18 months.</p>

<p>2025 brought significant organizational changes that reshaped how we work and the challenges we face. While change is never easy, it has been a powerful catalyst for growth, innovation, and resilience. The lessons learned from navigating these transitions have made us stronger, both as individuals and as a team.</p>

<h4 id="working-smarter-with-ai-">Working Smarter with AI 🤖</h4>

<p>One of the most exciting aspects of this transformation has been embracing cutting-edge technologies, particularly <strong>AI</strong>. At Derivco, we’re not just observing the AI revolution—we’re actively leveraging it to work smarter, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on what truly matters: innovation, creativity, and delivering exceptional value.</p>

<p>AI has become an integral part of my daily workflow—from coding assistance to problem-solving, architecture decisions to optimization strategies. However, this powerful tool has also highlighted one of the most critical challenges we face: <strong>balancing speed and quality</strong>. AI enables us to move faster than ever before, but speed without quality is just recklessness. Finding that sweet spot—where we leverage AI’s capabilities while maintaining the craftsmanship and attention to detail that truly matters—remains an ongoing challenge. It’s a balance I’m committed to mastering in 2026.</p>

<h4 id="resilience-through-change-">Resilience Through Change 💪</h4>

<p>The organizational changes of 2025 taught me valuable lessons about resilience and adaptation. Saying goodbye to talented colleagues and friends was difficult, but it also reinforced the importance of supporting one another, staying positive, and focusing on building something even better. For those of us who remain, we have a unique opportunity to help shape Derivco’s future—bringing our best ideas, dedication, and passion to create something extraordinary.</p>

<h4 id="looking-forward-to-year-19-">Looking Forward to Year 19 🚀</h4>

<p>As I approach my 19th year at Derivco, I’m more excited than ever about what lies ahead. The challenges are bigger, the technology is advancing faster, and the opportunities to make a meaningful impact are greater than ever. I’m grateful for the incredible people I work with, whose creativity and determination continue to inspire me every day.</p>

<p>Here’s to another year of growth, innovation, and pushing boundaries together!</p>

<h2 id="-looking-forward">🌟 Looking Forward</h2>

<p>2026 represents a turning point—a year where I’m choosing to prioritize what truly matters. The lessons from 2025, both the challenges and the triumphs, have shaped a clearer vision for the road ahead.</p>

<p>Here’s to a year of balance, growth, intentional living, and meaningful progress. Here’s to health, family, and building a future we can all be proud of.</p>

<p><strong>Happy New Year! Let’s make 2026 extraordinary! 🎊</strong></p>

We’ve experienced major organizational changes that have affected many talented people — colleagues, friends, and incredible contributors to our journey. Change of this magnitude is never easy, but I believe it’s important to reflect on this moment with honesty, empathy, and optimism for the future.</p>

<h2 id="to-those-moving-on-">To Those Moving On 🌟</h2>

<p>If you’re one of the many talented individuals who are moving on from Derivco, I want you to know: this is not your fault, and it doesn’t diminish your value or your contributions. You’ve been part of building something special, and the impact you’ve made will endure long after you’ve moved to your next adventure.</p>

<h3 id="embrace-this-new-chapter">Embrace This New Chapter</h3>

<p>While it may not feel like it right now, this change is an opportunity — a chance to explore new paths, take on different challenges, and discover strengths you didn’t know you had. The skills, experiences, and relationships you’ve built at Derivco are yours to carry forward. They’ll serve you well wherever your journey takes you next.</p>

<h3 id="change-makes-us-stronger">Change Makes Us Stronger</h3>

<p>Change is uncomfortable. It forces us out of our routines and into the unknown. But it’s also where growth happens. Every transition I’ve faced in my career — even the difficult ones — has taught me something valuable and made me more resilient. This moment will do the same for you. Embrace it, learn from it, and let it propel you forward.</p>

<h3 id="stay-positive-and-keep-riding">Stay Positive and Keep Riding</h3>

<p>The tech industry is full of opportunities for talented people like you. Take this momentum and ride it toward something new and exciting.

I’m rooting for you, and I know you’re going to do amazing things.</p>

<h2 id="to-those-staying-️">To Those Staying 🛡️</h2>

<p>For those of us who remain at Derivco, we face our own challenges. We’ve said goodbye to friends and colleagues, and we’re navigating a different landscape than we knew before. But we’re still here, and we have an important role to play in shaping what comes next.</p>

<h3 id="stay-strong-and-positive">Stay Strong and Positive</h3>

<p>It’s natural to feel uncertain during times of change. But we need to stay positive and support each other. The bonds we’ve built and the passion we share for what we do are more important than ever. Together, we can weather this transition and come out stronger on the other side.</p>

<h3 id="work-smarter-not-harder">Work Smarter, Not Harder</h3>

<p>One of the silver linings of this era is the incredible pace of technological advancement — particularly in AI. We have tools at our disposal that can help us work more efficiently, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on what truly matters: innovation, creativity, and delivering value. Let’s embrace these technologies and use them to amplify our impact. Working smarter, not harder, isn’t just a cliché — it’s a necessity and an opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-future-together">Building the Future Together</h3>

<p>We have a chance to help rebuild and reshape Derivco into something even better. Our input, our ideas, and our dedication matter. Let’s bring our best selves to work every day and show what’s possible when talented people come together with purpose and determination.</p>

<h2 id="learning-and-moving-forward-">Learning and Moving Forward 🚀</h2>

<p>Organizations, like people, grow through adversity. For Derivco, this is a moment to reflect, learn, and improve. Major changes like these should prompt us to ask hard questions: How can we be better? How can we support our people more effectively? How can we build a more resilient and sustainable future?</p>

<p>Change is an opportunity for renewal. It’s a chance to examine what worked, what didn’t, and what we want to be different going forward. I’m hopeful that Derivco will take these lessons to heart and emerge as a stronger, more thoughtful organization.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-">Final Thoughts 💭</h2>

<p>To everyone affected by these changes — whether you’re moving on or staying — thank you for your contributions, your passion, and your resilience. The tech industry is full of ups and downs, but it’s the people who make it all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Let’s support each other through this transition. Let’s stay connected, stay positive, and keep pushing forward. Whether we’re embarking on new adventures or continuing the journey at Derivco, we all have bright futures ahead.</p>

<p>Here’s to strength through change, to new opportunities, and to the incredible things we’ll all achieve next. 🌟</p>

<p>As I sit here on the morning of my 40th birthday, it feels like one of those pivotal moments where life slows down just long enough for you to take stock of the journey so far.</p>

<p>40 years—it’s hard to believe! It feels like just yesterday I was starting my career as a developer, uncertain of where the path might lead, but with a hunger to learn, grow, and build. Now, 15+ years into the world of software development, I find myself not only proud of what I’ve achieved professionally but also incredibly thankful for the life I’ve built beyond the office.</p>

<p>Turning 40 feels like a milestone that invites deeper reflection on personal growth. It’s a time to appreciate the journey I’ve been on—both the challenges and triumphs that have shaped who I am today. More than any professional achievement, it’s the experiences with my family that I cherish the most. The laughter, the shared adventures, and the simple joys of being together have been the greatest rewards. From spontaneous road trips to cozy nights at home, every moment spent with my loved ones is a testament to the richness of life and the importance of savoring these times.</p>

<p>Personal growth over these years has been as much about learning from my experiences as it has been about sharing them. Watching my children grow, embracing new hobbies, and finding balance in life’s many demands have all contributed to a deeper understanding of myself and what truly matters. It’s not just about the milestones but about the everyday moments of fun, connection, and love that define this journey.</p>

<p>As I reflect on these 40 years, I’m filled with gratitude for the growth that comes from both the joys and the challenges. It’s a reminder that the journey of life is best appreciated not just through accomplishments but through the meaningful connections and experiences we create along the way.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-behind-me-career-and-family-milestones-️"><strong>The Path Behind Me: Career and Family Milestones 🛤️</strong></h2>

<p>My journey into software development was fueled by curiosity and passion. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate enough to work on some amazing projects, collaborating with brilliant minds, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Every bug squashed, every line of code refined has been a small victory that adds up to the bigger picture.</p>

<p>But my greatest achievements aren’t found in any code repository or project milestone—they’re in the family I’ve built. I’m the proud father of two incredible kids who bring joy, laughter, and the occasional (but always endearing) chaos into my life. My daughter is full of joy, with a love for art that inspires me daily. She also finds immense pleasure in baking and cooking for our family, turning every meal into a special occasion with her creativity and care. My son, the older of the two, is strong and brave—always tackling challenges with a determination that makes me so proud. His passion for computers and gaming reminds me of my own interests when I was younger, bringing a sense of nostalgia and connection to my own childhood. Both of them share a passion for gymnastics, and watching them grow through that sport has been one of my greatest joys.</p>

<p>And to my amazing wife, who’s been my rock, my cheerleader, and my greatest partner in this adventure of life—words will never fully express my gratitude. She runs our household with incredible efficiency, homeschools our children with dedication and love, and supports them tirelessly at their gymnastics practices and competitions. Her unwavering support extends to my career as well, always encouraging me and providing the stability that allows me to pursue my professional goals. Her strength, patience, and love are the foundation of our family, and I am endlessly thankful for her.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-journey-so-far-"><strong>Lessons from the Journey So Far 📚</strong></h2>

<p>If there’s one thing that life has taught me over these 40 years, it’s that balance is everything. As passionate as I am about my work, nothing compares to the fulfillment of being a present father and a supportive husband. Finding that balance between family and career has been one of the most rewarding and challenging aspects of my life. There’s no “perfect” way to juggle it all, but I’ve learned that showing up with love, patience, and persistence goes a long way.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve faced countless challenges—some technical, some personal—but each one has been a lesson in growth. Whether it’s debugging a stubborn issue late into the night or guiding my children through their own mini life crises, I’ve come to appreciate that problem-solving is universal. And sometimes, the most rewarding solutions aren’t the ones you planned for.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead-whats-next-for-me-"><strong>Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Me 🔮</strong></h2>

<p>As I look forward to the next decade, I feel a renewed sense of excitement and curiosity. There are still so many things I want to achieve, both personally and professionally. I plan to continue evolving in the ever-changing world of software development, perhaps diving deeper into new technologies, while also nurturing my passion for exploration and adventure.</p>

<p>On the family front, I want to travel more, exploring the world with my wife and kids, creating lasting memories together. Whether it’s a new city, a new culture, or just a simple getaway, the goal is to enjoy life to the fullest with them, while also ensuring a prosperous future for my children. I want to be there for all the little and big moments, cheering them on at their gymnastics comps, watching my daughter create her next masterpiece, supporting my son’s gaming pursuits, and enjoying new experiences together as a family.</p>

<p><img src="https://andrewbevan.me/assets/images/2024-08-16-turning-40-family.jpg" alt="Family" title="Family" /></p>

<p>On a more personal note, I’m looking forward to spending more time on hobbies—gardening and tinkering with new projects. Whether it’s nurturing a new plant or building something from scratch, these hands-on activities bring me a sense of calm and creativity that I plan to explore even further in the years ahead.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-of-gratitude-"><strong>A Note of Gratitude 🙏</strong></h2>

<p>Turning 40 isn’t just about reflection—it’s also about gratitude. To my family, friends, and colleagues who’ve been part of this incredible journey—thank you. Each of you has contributed in some way to who I am today, and I am so thankful for the love, support, and shared experiences.</p>

<p>Here’s to the next chapter. If it’s anything like the first 40 years, it’s bound to be one amazing ride.</p>
