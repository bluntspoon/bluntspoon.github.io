<p>As I sit here on the morning of my 40th birthday, it feels like one of those pivotal moments where life slows down just long enough for you to take stock of the journey so far.</p>

<p>40 years—it’s hard to believe! It feels like just yesterday I was starting my career as a developer, uncertain of where the path might lead, but with a hunger to learn, grow, and build. Now, 15+ years into the world of software development, I find myself not only proud of what I’ve achieved professionally but also incredibly thankful for the life I’ve built beyond the office.</p>

<p>Turning 40 feels like a milestone that invites deeper reflection on personal growth. It’s a time to appreciate the journey I’ve been on—both the challenges and triumphs that have shaped who I am today. More than any professional achievement, it’s the experiences with my family that I cherish the most. The laughter, the shared adventures, and the simple joys of being together have been the greatest rewards. From spontaneous road trips to cozy nights at home, every moment spent with my loved ones is a testament to the richness of life and the importance of savoring these times.</p>

<p>Personal growth over these years has been as much about learning from my experiences as it has been about sharing them. Watching my children grow, embracing new hobbies, and finding balance in life’s many demands have all contributed to a deeper understanding of myself and what truly matters. It’s not just about the milestones but about the everyday moments of fun, connection, and love that define this journey.</p>

<p>As I reflect on these 40 years, I’m filled with gratitude for the growth that comes from both the joys and the challenges. It’s a reminder that the journey of life is best appreciated not just through accomplishments but through the meaningful connections and experiences we create along the way.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-behind-me-career-and-family-milestones-️"><strong>The Path Behind Me: Career and Family Milestones 🛤️</strong></h2>

<p>My journey into software development was fueled by curiosity and passion. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate enough to work on some amazing projects, collaborating with brilliant minds, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Every bug squashed, every line of code refined has been a small victory that adds up to the bigger picture.</p>

<p>But my greatest achievements aren’t found in any code repository or project milestone—they’re in the family I’ve built. I’m the proud father of two incredible kids who bring joy, laughter, and the occasional (but always endearing) chaos into my life. My daughter is full of joy, with a love for art that inspires me daily. She also finds immense pleasure in baking and cooking for our family, turning every meal into a special occasion with her creativity and care. My son, the older of the two, is strong and brave—always tackling challenges with a determination that makes me so proud. His passion for computers and gaming reminds me of my own interests when I was younger, bringing a sense of nostalgia and connection to my own childhood. Both of them share a passion for gymnastics, and watching them grow through that sport has been one of my greatest joys.</p>

<p>And to my amazing wife, who’s been my rock, my cheerleader, and my greatest partner in this adventure of life—words will never fully express my gratitude. She runs our household with incredible efficiency, homeschools our children with dedication and love, and supports them tirelessly at their gymnastics practices and competitions. Her unwavering support extends to my career as well, always encouraging me and providing the stability that allows me to pursue my professional goals. Her strength, patience, and love are the foundation of our family, and I am endlessly thankful for her.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-journey-so-far-"><strong>Lessons from the Journey So Far 📚</strong></h2>

<p>If there’s one thing that life has taught me over these 40 years, it’s that balance is everything. As passionate as I am about my work, nothing compares to the fulfillment of being a present father and a supportive husband. Finding that balance between family and career has been one of the most rewarding and challenging aspects of my life. There’s no “perfect” way to juggle it all, but I’ve learned that showing up with love, patience, and persistence goes a long way.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve faced countless challenges—some technical, some personal—but each one has been a lesson in growth. Whether it’s debugging a stubborn issue late into the night or guiding my children through their own mini life crises, I’ve come to appreciate that problem-solving is universal. And sometimes, the most rewarding solutions aren’t the ones you planned for.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead-whats-next-for-me-"><strong>Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Me 🔮</strong></h2>

<p>As I look forward to the next decade, I feel a renewed sense of excitement and curiosity. There are still so many things I want to achieve, both personally and professionally. I plan to continue evolving in the ever-changing world of software development, perhaps diving deeper into new technologies, while also nurturing my passion for exploration and adventure.</p>

<p>On the family front, I want to travel more, exploring the world with my wife and kids, creating lasting memories together. Whether it’s a new city, a new culture, or just a simple getaway, the goal is to enjoy life to the fullest with them, while also ensuring a prosperous future for my children. I want to be there for all the little and big moments, cheering them on at their gymnastics comps, watching my daughter create her next masterpiece, supporting my son’s gaming pursuits, and enjoying new experiences together as a family.</p>

<p><img src="https://andrewbevan.me/assets/images/2024-08-16-turning-40-family.jpg" alt="Family" title="Family" /></p>

<p>On a more personal note, I’m looking forward to spending more time on hobbies—gardening and tinkering with new projects. Whether it’s nurturing a new plant or building something from scratch, these hands-on activities bring me a sense of calm and creativity that I plan to explore even further in the years ahead.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-of-gratitude-"><strong>A Note of Gratitude 🙏</strong></h2>

<p>Turning 40 isn’t just about reflection—it’s also about gratitude. To my family, friends, and colleagues who’ve been part of this incredible journey—thank you. Each of you has contributed in some way to who I am today, and I am so thankful for the love, support, and shared experiences.</p>

<p>Here’s to the next chapter. If it’s anything like the first 40 years, it’s bound to be one amazing ride.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Thought:</strong>
<em>“Life isn’t measured in years, but in experiences—and I’m incredibly lucky to have had so many extraordinary ones. Here’s to 40 years of growth, love, and adventure, with many more to come.”</em></p>
