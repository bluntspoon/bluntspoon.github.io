We’ve experienced major organizational changes that have affected many talented people — colleagues, friends, and incredible contributors to our journey. Change of this magnitude is never easy, but I believe it’s important to reflect on this moment with honesty, empathy, and optimism for the future.</p>

<h2 id="to-those-moving-on-">To Those Moving On 🌟</h2>

<p>If you’re one of the many talented individuals who are moving on from Derivco, I want you to know: this is not your fault, and it doesn’t diminish your value or your contributions. You’ve been part of building something special, and the impact you’ve made will endure long after you’ve moved to your next adventure.</p>

<h3 id="embrace-this-new-chapter">Embrace This New Chapter</h3>

<p>While it may not feel like it right now, this change is an opportunity — a chance to explore new paths, take on different challenges, and discover strengths you didn’t know you had. The skills, experiences, and relationships you’ve built at Derivco are yours to carry forward. They’ll serve you well wherever your journey takes you next.</p>

<h3 id="change-makes-us-stronger">Change Makes Us Stronger</h3>

<p>Change is uncomfortable. It forces us out of our routines and into the unknown. But it’s also where growth happens. Every transition I’ve faced in my career — even the difficult ones — has taught me something valuable and made me more resilient. This moment will do the same for you. Embrace it, learn from it, and let it propel you forward.</p>

<h3 id="stay-positive-and-keep-riding">Stay Positive and Keep Riding</h3>

<p>The tech industry is full of opportunities for talented people like you. Take this momentum and ride it toward something new and exciting. Stay connected with your network, keep your skills sharp, and remain open to possibilities. Your next opportunity might be the best one yet. I’m rooting for you, and I know you’re going to do amazing things.</p>

<h2 id="to-those-staying-️">To Those Staying 🛡️</h2>

<p>For those of us who remain at Derivco, we face our own challenges. We’ve said goodbye to friends and colleagues, and we’re navigating a different landscape than we knew before. But we’re still here, and we have an important role to play in shaping what comes next.</p>

<h3 id="stay-strong-and-positive">Stay Strong and Positive</h3>

<p>It’s natural to feel uncertain during times of change. But we need to stay positive and support each other. The bonds we’ve built and the passion we share for what we do are more important than ever. Together, we can weather this transition and come out stronger on the other side.</p>

<h3 id="work-smarter-not-harder">Work Smarter, Not Harder</h3>

<p>One of the silver linings of this era is the incredible pace of technological advancement — particularly in AI. We have tools at our disposal that can help us work more efficiently, automate repetitive tasks, and focus on what truly matters: innovation, creativity, and delivering value. Let’s embrace these technologies and use them to amplify our impact. Working smarter, not harder, isn’t just a cliché — it’s a necessity and an opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-future-together">Building the Future Together</h3>

<p>We have a chance to help rebuild and reshape Derivco into something even better. Our input, our ideas, and our dedication matter. Let’s bring our best selves to work every day and show what’s possible when talented people come together with purpose and determination.</p>

<h2 id="learning-and-moving-forward-">Learning and Moving Forward 🚀</h2>

<p>Organizations, like people, grow through adversity. For Derivco, this is a moment to reflect, learn, and improve. Major changes like these should prompt us to ask hard questions: How can we be better? How can we support our people more effectively? How can we build a more resilient and sustainable future?</p>

<p>Change is an opportunity for renewal. It’s a chance to examine what worked, what didn’t, and what we want to be different going forward. I’m hopeful that Derivco will take these lessons to heart and emerge as a stronger, more thoughtful organization.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-">Final Thoughts 💭</h2>

<p>To everyone affected by these changes — whether you’re moving on or staying — thank you for your contributions, your passion, and your resilience. The tech industry is full of ups and downs, but it’s the people who make it all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Let’s support each other through this transition. Let’s stay connected, stay positive, and keep pushing forward. Whether we’re embarking on new adventures or continuing the journey at Derivco, we all have bright futures ahead.</p>

<p>Here’s to strength through change, to new opportunities, and to the incredible things we’ll all achieve next. 🌟</p>
